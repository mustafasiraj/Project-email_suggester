# ðŸ“§ AI Email Auto-Responder

â”œâ”€â”€ suggested_reply.txt   # Stores replies for reference

# ðŸ“Œ Notes
This project only suggests a reply â€” it does not send emails automatically.

Works best for simple and short text emails.

Ensure you have a stable internet connection (the model loads from Hugging Face).
